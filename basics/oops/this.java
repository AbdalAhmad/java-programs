/*The this keyword in Java is used to refer to the current instance of the class. It has several common uses:

Referencing Instance Variables: It is used to distinguish between instance variables (attributes) and local variables or method parameters with the same name. When the instance variable and local variable have the same name, this helps you access the instance variable.
Example:
java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private String name; // Instance variable

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name; // 'this' refers to the instance variable
    }
}
Calling Another Constructor: It is used to call another constructor within the same class. This is often used to avoid code duplication when you have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
Example:
java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private String name;

    public Student() {
        this("Unknown"); // Calls the constructor with a default name
    }

    public Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
Returning the Current Instance: It can be used to return the current instance from a method, allowing for method chaining. This is common in builder design patterns.
Example:
java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student withName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this; // Allows method chaining
    }

    public Student withAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
        return this; // Allows method chaining
    }
}
In all these cases, this is used to refer to the current object (instance of the class) and helps in disambiguating between instance variables and local variables, and in calling constructors or returning the current instance.
